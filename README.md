# Goal-Based Vector Field Pathfinding
This is a simple example implemenation of the Goal-Based Vector Field Pathfinding Algorithm

I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bspb9g9nTto) to understand the basics of this algorithm and implemented it by myself. I used [Processing](https://processing.org/) as my base.
